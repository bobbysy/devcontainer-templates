Development Container Templates
---

A development container is a running Docker container with a well-defined tool/runtime stack and its prerequisites. It allows you to use a container as a full-featured development environment which can be used to run an application, to separate tools, libraries, or runtimes needed for working with a codebase, and to aid in continuous integration and testing.

This repository contains a set of Dev Container Templates which are source files packaged together that encode configuration for a complete development environment. A Template can be used in a new or existing project, and a supporting tool will use the configuration from the template to build a development container.
